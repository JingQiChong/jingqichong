- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jing Qi and I recently started as a research assistant (bioinformatics) under ([Prof. Albert Tenesa](https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/albert-tenesa)).I am also a fresh graduate from the University of Edinburgh, holding a bachelor degree, BSc (Hons) Biological Sciences (Genetics). 
- I first started Github for my honours project which is about developing a better bioinformatics workflow to quantify the interaction between RNA and protein ([nf_CRACpipeline](https://github.com/JingQiChong/nf_CRACpipeline)).
