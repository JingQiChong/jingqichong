# <div align="center">ðŸ‘‹ Hello, welcome to my world!ðŸ‘‹</div>

My name is Jing Qi and I am a research assistant in [Prof. Albert Tenesa](https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/albert-tenesa)'s lab at the Roslin Institute. Currently, I am working on a bioinformatics project focusing on livestock genomics and developing a bioinformatics workflow that select desirable CpG sites for inclusion in a DNA methylation array. My research interest lies in functional genetics and genomics and I am keen of their applications in disease and livestock settings. 

I graduated from the University of Edinburgh recently (June 2022) with a bachelor degree in BSc (Hons) Biological Sciences (Genetics). I learned and gained experiences in biofinformatics by participtating various projects during undergraduate life.In summer 2021, I did a two months placement in [Dr.James Prendergast](https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/james-prendergast), which I examined the Boran genome to determine the potential causal variant that confers tolerance to East Coast Fever. During my final (honours) year, I chose a bioinformatics orientated project in [wallace lab](https://ewallace.github.io/), under the supervision of [Dr.Edward Wallace](https://ewallace.github.io/team/edward-wallace) and [Dr.Sam Haynes](https://ewallace.github.io/team/samuel-haynes). My honours project was about studying the RNA-protein interaction in yeast, focusing on Khd1, and I have developed an improved version of bioinformatics workflow to analyse the interaction between RNA and protein under the guidance of my supervisors.

Despite doing dry lab most of the time, I am still a geneticist by heart. My future plan after current job is to further my study by doing a Master by Research or a Phd Nevertheless, I hope to have wet lab component in either choice.

If you have query in my previous work or discussion on genetics, please feel free to contact me via my [email](jchong@ed.ac.uk).
