My name is Jing Qi and I am currently a research assistant in [Prof. Albert Tenesa](https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/albert-tenesa)'s lab at the Roslin Institute. I am currently working on developing a bioinformatics workflow that select suitable sites for a DNA methylation array using publicly available methylation data (Bisulphite Sequencing). I recently graduated from the University of Edinburgh holding a bachelor degree in BSc (Hons) Biological Sciences (Genetics).
 
I first started Github for my honours project which is about developing a better bioinformatics workflow to quantify the interaction between RNA and protein ([nf_CRACpipeline](https://github.com/JingQiChong/nf_CRACpipeline)). I did my project with [Dr.Edward Wallace](https://ewallace.github.io/team/edward-wallace) and [Dr.Sam Haynes](https://ewallace.github.io/team/samuel-haynes). I am very grateful to both of them on their guidance in doing good research and bioinformatics.
