- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is Jing Qi and I am a research assistant (livestock epigenomics and bioinformatics) in [Prof. Albert Tenesa](https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/albert-tenesa)'s lab at the Roslin Institute. I started this job around Noveber 2022 after I graduated from the University of Edinburgh with a bachelor degree in BSc (Hons) Biological Sciences (Genetics).
 
- I first started Github for my honours project which is about developing a better bioinformatics workflow to quantify the interaction between RNA and protein ([nf_CRACpipeline](https://github.com/JingQiChong/nf_CRACpipeline)). I did my project with [Dr.Edward Wallace](https://ewallace.github.io/team/edward-wallace) and [Sam Haynes](https://ewallace.github.io/team/samuel-haynes). I received a lot of guidance from them on doing bioinformatics.

- Currently, I am learning more about bioinformatics while working and I am happy to receive any comments on my work!(especially nf_CRACpipeline).
