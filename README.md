# <div align="center">ðŸ‘‹ Hello, welcome to my world!ðŸ‘‹</div>

My name is Jing Qi and I am a research assistant in [Prof Albert Tenesa](https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/albert-tenesa)'s lab at the Roslin Institute. Currently, I am working on a bioinformatics project with [Dr Pau Navarro](https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/pau-navarro), focusing on livestock genomics and developing a bioinformatics workflow capable of tailoring a DNA methylation array to the user's needs. 

My research interest lies in multi-omics, and I am keen on applying these approaches to understand the variation of traits between individuals in disease and livestock settings. Moreover, my bioinformatician alter ego enjoys developing tools and reproducible workflows for data analysis.

I graduated from the University of Edinburgh recently (June 2022) with a degree in BSc (Hons) Biological Sciences (Genetics). I learned and gained experience in bioinformatics by participating in various projects during my undergraduate life. In the summer of 2021, I did a two month placement with [Prof James Prendergast](https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/james-prendergast), in which I examined a Boran genome to determine the potential causal variant that confers tolerance to East Coast Fever. During my final (honours) year, I chose a bioinformatics-orientated project in [The Wallace Lab](https://ewallace.github.io/), under the supervision of [Dr Edward Wallace](https://ewallace.github.io/team/edward-wallace) and [Dr Sam Haynes](https://ewallace.github.io/team/samuel-haynes). My honours project was about studying the RNA-protein interaction in *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*, focusing on Khd1. I also developed an improved version of bioinformatics workflow to analyse the interaction between RNA and protein.

Despite having a bioinformatics-focused background, I am eager to learn wet lab skills for my research interests. My future plan after my current job is to further my studies by doing a PhD.

If you are interested in my previous work or want to have a discussion on genetics, please feel free to contact me via my [email](jchong@ed.ac.uk).
