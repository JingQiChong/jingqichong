# <div align="center">ðŸ‘‹ Hello, welcome to my world!ðŸ‘‹</div>

My name is Jing Qi and I am a research assistant in [Prof Albert Tenesa](https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/albert-tenesa)'s lab at the Roslin Institute. Currently, I am working with [Dr Pau Navarro](https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/pau-navarro) to develop the first high-density DNA methylation array for cattle using a self-designed bioinformatics workflow. 

I am interested in understanding the molecular background of diseases in humans and livestock, utlising multi-omics and machine learning approaches. Moreover, my bioinformatician alter ego enjoys developing tools and reproducible workflows for data analysis.

I graduated from the University of Edinburgh with a degree in BSc (Hons) Biological Sciences (Genetics). I learned and gained experience in bioinformatics by participating in various projects during my undergraduate life. In the summer of 2021, I did a two month placement with [Prof James Prendergast](https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/james-prendergast), in which I examined a Boran genome to determine the potential causal variant that confers tolerance to East Coast Fever. During my final (honours) year, I chose a bioinformatics-orientated project in [The Wallace Lab](https://ewallace.github.io/), under the supervision of [Dr Edward Wallace](https://ewallace.github.io/team/edward-wallace) and [Dr Sam Haynes](https://ewallace.github.io/team/samuel-haynes). My honours project was about studying the RNA-protein interaction in *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*, focusing on Khd1. I also developed an improved version of bioinformatics workflow to analyse the interaction between RNA and protein.
